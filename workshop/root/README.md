>In this project you will have to create a system file explorer that allows the user to navigate, create directories and upload files in the same way as he would in his usual operating system. 

>The file explorer is a tool that allows you to directly view and manipulate the files and directories associated with a path, so you must take into account from which path the user starts and which path they can access.

## Requirements

- You cannot use file third-party libraries
- You will not be able to use global variables in PHP.
- You must use GIT
- You must use the PHP > v7

- Remember that it is important to divide the tasks into several sub-tasks so that in this way you can associate each particular step of the construction with a specific commit
- You should try as much as possible that the commits and the planned tasks are the same
Delete files that are not used or are not necessary to evaluate the project

We use Miró Application and UML Diagrams to organize and develop the code behaviour, to make easier the develop phase of the project.<br>
